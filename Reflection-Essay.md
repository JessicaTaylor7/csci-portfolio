# Reflection Essay
## Question 1: Discuss one challenge you overcame during your academic development. What was the challenge, was it technical, nontechnical, or both, and how did you overcome it?

One significant challenge I faced during my academic development was overcoming self-doubt, particularly in relation to math. Throughout high school and as I entered college, I had convinced myself that I was simply bad at math, which made the subject feel more daunting. However, during my college years, I began to realize that this mindset was holding me back. While math didn’t come naturally to me, I discovered that with extra practice and a shift in perspective, I could improve. I challenged myself to change my internal dialogue, replacing negative thoughts with affirmations like, "I am capable of succeeding in math." This shift in attitude, combined with consistent effort, allowed me to excel in higher-level math courses. Through this experience, I learned the importance of perseverance and a positive mindset in overcoming academic challenges.

## Question 2: Discuss a situation where you worked with a team. How would you describe yourself as a teammate? Where can you improve your team skills? Be specific.

In my Object-Oriented Programming class, I worked on a team project where we collaborated to develop a software solution. We began by breaking down the overall project into smaller, more manageable tasks, with each team member selecting one or two to focus on. We held weekly meetings to discuss our progress, address any challenges, and ensure that we were on track to meet our deadline. Through consistent communication and collaboration, we successfully completed the project on time and were proud of our collective effort.

As a teammate, I consider myself supportive and proactive. I value open communication and strive to foster an environment where everyone feels comfortable sharing their thoughts and concerns. I’m always willing to assist a teammate who needs help and believe in breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more achievable goals, setting timelines to ensure we stay organized and on schedule.

One area where I can improve my teamwork skills is in delegation. At times, I find myself taking on too many responsibilities to ensure everything is done correctly. Learning to trust my teammates with certain tasks and striking a balance between supporting the team and sharing the workload evenly is something I am continuously working on.

## Question 3: What type of career in CS do you believe you are most suited for? Why this field and not another? Be specific.

The career path in computer science I am most suited for is cybersecurity, specifically in roles that combine programming and data analysis within this field. I’m drawn to cybersecurity because it allows me to leverage my technical skills in coding while solving real-world problems related to security. I enjoy the challenge of writing secure code, detecting vulnerabilities, and analyzing data to identify potential threats and trends.

Unlike other areas in computer science, such as networking or highly math-intensive fields like machine learning, cybersecurity aligns better with my strengths and interests. I find satisfaction in protecting systems and ensuring the integrity of data, while also enjoying the technical aspects of programming. This balance of programming, security analysis, and data-driven decision-making makes cybersecurity an ideal fit for me.

While networking is a critical part of cybersecurity, it’s not something I’m as passionate about compared to analyzing data and developing security solutions through code. This focus is why I see myself excelling in roles like security analyst, penetration tester, or a cybersecurity engineer where programming, security, and data analysis intersect.

## Question 4: What professional organizations would you like to join? What professional development would you like to be a part of in the next five years? Be specific and don't consider places of employment.

In the next five years, I am interested in joining several professional organizations that align with my values and career aspirations. First, I would like to become a member of the American Scientific Affiliation (ASA), as it offers the opportunity to integrate my Christian faith with my professional life in a meaningful way. I believe that incorporating a Christian worldview into my work is important, and ASA provides a community that supports that perspective.

Additionally, joining the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and IEEE would be beneficial for staying informed about the latest developments in computing and technology, as well as for networking with professionals in the field. Both organizations offer invaluable resources for continued learning, conferences, and certifications, which are essential for growth in the rapidly evolving field of computer science and cybersecurity.

I am also passionate about supporting and empowering women in technology, so I would like to join the Association for Women in Computing (AWC), Charleston Women in Tech (Chs WIT), and the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT). These organizations provide a supportive network of women in technology, and I believe being part of such communities would allow me to contribute to and benefit from initiatives that promote diversity and inclusion in the tech industry.

Through these organizations, I aim to continue my professional development by attending conferences, participating in mentorship programs, and earning relevant certifications to advance my skills and knowledge in cybersecurity.

## Question 5: What are the ways you can use the skills you have learned in CS to serve your community? Be specific.

I believe there are several ways I can use the skills I've developed in computer science, particularly in cybersecurity, to serve my community. One area where I can make a significant impact is by helping local non-profit organizations, churches, and small businesses improve their cybersecurity practices. Many of these organizations may not have the resources or expertise to secure their systems against threats, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. I can volunteer my time to conduct security audits, implement basic protective measures, and educate staff on how to recognize potential security threats like phishing or malware.

Another way I can serve my community is by offering cybersecurity education and awareness programs. I could partner with schools, libraries, or community centers to teach basic cybersecurity skills, such as safe internet browsing, creating strong passwords, and protecting personal information online. This would not only help individuals protect themselves but also contribute to a safer online environment for the community as a whole.

Additionally, I can use my programming skills to develop custom tools or websites that benefit local organizations, helping them optimize their digital presence or streamline operations. For example, creating a user-friendly website for a non-profit or developing software to help them manage donations more efficiently could significantly enhance their impact.

By leveraging my technical expertise, I can support my community in staying safe online while also empowering organizations and individuals to thrive in the digital age.
